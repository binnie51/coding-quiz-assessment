# coding-quiz-assessment
As developer, I'm making an assessment for myself or other developers-in-training in a form of multiple choice questions in order to assesst our familiarity in basic JavaScript. Test-takers will be given limited amount of time to answer all questions and time will start ticking as soon as they click on "begin". Scores will be displayed at the end.
